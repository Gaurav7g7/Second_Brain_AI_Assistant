# Second_Brain_AI_Assistant
- This is an end to end project where I build a second brain(a knowledge base of my personal documents) AI assistant.

Here's the system architecture for the project -

The following concepts, algorithms and tools will be used in this project:
- Architecting an AI system using the FTI architecture.
- Using MLOps best practices such as data registries, model registries, and experiment trackers.
- Crawling over 700 links and normalizing everything into Markdown using Crawl4AI.
- Computing quality scores using LLMs.
- Generating summarization datasets using distillation.
- Fine-tuning a Llama model using Unsloth and Comet.
- Deploying the Llama model as an inference endpoint to Hugging Face serverless Dedicated Endpoints.
- Implement advanced RAG algorithms using contextual retrieval, hybrid search and MongoDB vector search.
- Build an agent that uses multiple tools using Hugging Faceâ€™s smolagents framework.
- Using LLMOps best practices such as prompt monitoring and RAG evaluation using Opik.
- Integrate pipeline orchestration, artifact and metadata tracking using ZenML.
- Manage the Python project using uv and ruff.
- Apply software engineering best practices.
